              <p>At some point in our lives, we’ve all had to live with another person: Parents. Siblings. Dormmates. Significant others. But living with someone is more than sleeping under the same roof; there’s joy, pining, gossip, conflict, and more. Inspired by the 2014 Vine, “and they were roommates” is dedicated to the friction of living together, what happens (and doesn’t happen) behind a shared door. Break-up letters, petty confessions, winking erotica: this zine has all the possibilities there are when you think of the word “roommates.” We hope you enjoy the companionship of the page as you read through these stories, poems, and pictures.</p>
