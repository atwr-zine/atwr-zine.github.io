        <em>Austin is dumb, cringe, deranged, and probably thinks you’re cute. He can’t stop telling people about Crash (the Cronenberg film) and has the second-best music taste in the world.</em>

        <em>Helia changes interests and life goals every two weeks and feels like she is being left behind. She has the greatest music taste in the world.</em>
